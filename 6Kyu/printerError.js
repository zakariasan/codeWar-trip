//You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

//The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.


function printerError(s) {
    // your code
    var count = 0;
    for(var i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
      if (s[i] > "m") {
        count++;
      }
    }
    return count+"/"+s.length;
}
